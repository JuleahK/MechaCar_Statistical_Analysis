- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset? Vehicle length and ground clearance

- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not? R-squared:  0.7149 slope not equal to zero, significant

- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not? the p-value of our linear regression analysis is 5.35e-11, which is much smaller than our assumed significance level of 0.05%. Therefore, we can state that there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which means that the slope of our linear model is not zero.
